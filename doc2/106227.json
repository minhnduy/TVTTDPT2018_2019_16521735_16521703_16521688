Kingsley is best known as the author ofWater Babies. Although this is not the first time this text has appeared on the Internet, this is the only version with the complete set of Squire and Mars black and white and four-color art-deco illustrations. This includes two illustrations censored from later editions, probably because of female nudity. This also includes the original Preface, which was omitted from later editions. Otherwise the text, particularly the punctuation, was proofed according to a 1901 edition.", "detailLink": "https://waka.vn/the-heroes-or-greek-fairy-tales-for-my-children-r0XNZW.html?type=1", "thumpnail": "https://307a0e78.vws.vegacdn.vn/view/v2/image/img.book/0/0/0/5836.jpg?v=2&w=200&h=292"}
