Andersen; 2 April 1805 â€“ 4 August 1875) was a Danish author. Although a prolific writer of plays, travelogues, novels, and poems, Andersen is best remembered for his fairy tales. Andersen's popularity is not limited to children; his stories, called eventyr in Danish, or \"fairy-tales\" in English, express themes that transcend age and nationality. Andersen's fairy tales, which have been translated into more than 125 languages, have become culturally embedded in the West's collective consciousness, readily accessible to children, but presenting lessons of virtue and resilience in the face of adversity for mature readers as well. Some of his most famous fairy tales include \"The Little Mermaid\", \"The Snow Queen\", \"The Ugly Duckling\", \"The Nightingale\", \"The Emperor's New Clothes\" and many more. His stories have inspired plays, ballets, and both live-action and animated films.", "detailLink": "https://waka.vn/hans-andersen-s-fairy-tale-rKj4rW.html?type=1", "thumpnail": "https://307a0e78.vws.vegacdn.vn/view/v2/image/img.book/0/0/0/5858.jpg?v=2&w=200&h=292"}
